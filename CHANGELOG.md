# pyld ChangeLog

### Changed
* **BREAKING**: Versions of Python before 3.6 are no longer supported.
* Update conformance docs.
* Add all keywords and update options.
* Default processingMode to json-ld-1.1.
* Implement logic for marking tests as pending, so that it will fail if a pending test passes.
* Consolidate documentLoader option and defaults into a load_document method to also handle JSON (eventually HTML) parsing.
* Add support for rel=alternate for non-JSON-LD docs.
* Context processing:
  * Support `@propagate` in context processing and propagate option.
  * Support for `@import`. (Some issues confusing recursion errors for invalid contexts).
  * Make `override_protected` and `propagate` optional arguments to `_create_term_definition` and `_process_context` instead of using option argument.
  * Improve management of previous contexts.
  * Imported contexts must resolve to an object.
  * Do remote context processing from within _process_contexts, as logic is too complicated for pre-loading. Removes _find_context_urls and _retrieve_context_urls.
  * Added a ContextResolver which can used a shared LRU cache for storing
    externally retrieved contexts, and the result of processing them relative
    to a particular active context.
  * Return a "frozendict" from context processing and reduce deepcopies.
  * Store inverse context in an LRU cache rather than trying to modify a frozen context.
* Create Term Definition:
  * Allow `@type` as a term under certain circumstances.
  * Reject and warn on keyword-like terms.
  * Support protected term definitions.
  * Look for keyword patterns and warn/return.
  * Look for terms that are compact IRIs that don't expand to the same thing.
  * Basic support for `@json` and `@none` as values of `@type`.
  * If `@container` includes `@type`, `@type` must be `@id` or `@vocab`.
  * Support `@index` and `@direction`.
  * Corner-case checking for `@prefix`.
  * Validate scoped contexts even if not used.
  * Support relative vocabulary IRIs.
  * Fix check that term has the form of an IRI.
  * Delay adding mapping to end of _create_term_definition.
  * If a scoped context is null, wrap it in an array so it doesn't seem to be undefined.
* IRI Expansion:
  * Find keyword patterns.
  * Don't treat terms starting with a colon as IRIs.
  * Only return a resulting IRI if it is absolute.
  * Fix _is_absolute_iri to use a reasonable regular expression and some other _expand_iri issues.
  * Fix to detecting relative IRIs.
  * Fix special case where relative path should not have a leading '/'
* Compaction:
  * Compact `@direction`.
  * Compact `@type`: `@none`.
  * Compact `@included`.
  * Honor `@container`: `@set` on `@type`.
  * Lists of Lists.
  * Improve handling of scoped contexts and propagate.
  * Improve map compaction, including indexed properties.
  * Catch Absolute IRI confused with prefix.
* Expansion:
  * Updates to expansion algorithm.
  * _expand_value adds `@direction` from term definition.
  * JSON Literals.
  * support `@direction` when expanding.
  * support lists of lists.
  * support property indexes.
  * improve graph container expansion.
  * Order types when applying scoped contexts.
  * Use type_scoped_ctx when expanding values of `@type`.
  * Use propagate and override_protected properly when creating expansion contexts.
* Flattening:
  * Rewrite _create_node_map based on 1.1 algorithm.
  * Flatten `@included`.
  * Flatten lists of lists.
  * Update merge_node_maps for `@type`.
* ToRdf:
  * Support for I18N direction.
  * Support for Lists of Lists.
  * Partial support for JSON canonicalization of JSON literals.
    * Includes local copy of JCS library, but doesn't load.
  * Lists of Lists.
  * Text Direction 'i18n-datatype'.

## 1.0.5 - 2019-05-09

### Fixed
- Use `return` instead of `raise StopIteration` to terminate generator.

## 1.0.4 - 2018-12-11

### Fixed
- Accept N-Quads upper case language tag.

## 1.0.3 - 2018-03-09

### Fixed
- Reorder code to avoid undefined symbols.

## 1.0.2 - 2018-03-08

### Fixed
- Missing error parameter.

## 1.0.1 - 2018-03-06

### Fixed
- Include document loaders in distribution.

## 1.0.0 - 2018-03-06

### Notes
- **1.0.0**!
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is now past the "initial
  development" 0.x.y stage (after 6+ years!).
- [Conformance](README.rst#conformance):
  - JSON-LD 1.0 + JSON-LD 1.0 errata
  - JSON-LD 1.1 drafts
- Thanks to the JSON-LD and related communities and the many many people over
  the years who contributed ideas, code, bug reports, and support!

### Fixed
- Don't always use arrays for `@graph`. Fixes 1.0 compatibility issue.
- Process @type term contexts before key iteration.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: A dependency of pyld will not pull in [Requests][] anymore.
  One needs to define a dependency to `pyld[requests]` or create an
  explicit dependency on `requests` seperately. Use `pyld[aiohttp]` for
  [aiohttp][].
- The default document loader is set to `request_document_loader`. If
  [Requests][] is not available, `aiohttp_document_loader` is used. When
  [aiohttp][] is not availabke, a `dummy_document_loader` is used.
- Use the W3C standard MIME type for N-Quads of "application/n-quads". Accept
  "application/nquads" for compatibility.

### Added
- Support for asynchronous document loader library [aiohttp][].
- Added `dummy_document_loader` which allows libraries to depend on
  pyld without depending on [Requests][] or [aiohttp][].
- The test runner contains an additional parameter `-l` to specify the
  default document loader.
- Expansion and Compaction using scoped contexts on property and `@type` terms.
- Expansion and Compaction of nested properties.
- Index graph containers using `@id` and `@index`, with `@set` variations.
- Index node objects using `@id` and `@type`, with `@set` variations.
- Framing default and named graphs in addition to merged graph.
- Value patterns when framing, allowing a subset of values to appear in the
  output.

## 0.8.2 - 2017-10-24

### Fixed
- Use default document loader for older exposed `load_document` API.

## 0.8.1 - 2017-10-24

### Fixed
- Use `__about__.py` to hold versioning and other meta data. Load file in
  `setup.py` and `jsonld.py`. Fixes testing and installation issues.

## 0.8.0 - 2017-10-20

### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: Default http (80) and https (443) ports removed from URLs. This
  matches test suite behavior and other processing libs such as [jsonld.js][].
- **BREAKING**: Fix path normalization to pass test suite RFC 3984 tests. This
  could change output for various relative URL edge cases.
- Allow empty lists to be compacted to any `@list` container term. (Port from
  [jsonld.js][])

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Remove older document loader code. SSL/SNI support wasn't
  working well with newer Pythons.
- **BREAKING**: Switch to [Requests][] for document loading. Some behavior
  could slightly change. Better supported in Python 2 and Python 3.

### Added
- Support for test suite using http or https.
- Easier to create a custom Requests document loader with the
  `requests_document_loader` call. Adds a `secure` flag to always use HTTPS.
  Can pass in keywords that [Requests][] understands. `verify` to disable SSL
  verification or use custom cert bundles. `cert` to use client certs.
  `timeout` to fail on timeouts (important for production use!). See
  [Requests][] docs for more info.
